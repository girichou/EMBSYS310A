a. Explain what the “main” function does in order to setup the input arguments prior to calling the swap_pointer() function?

1. program PUSHes LR, and R3-R7 on to the stack as it is a callee is responsibility. Then program uses R0 and R1 along with SP and PC to load the values of variable x(2000000) and y(1000000) on directly on stack where R4 and R5 is stored. This makes x and y addreses available for references. Then using SP and offset operand the x& y addresses are copied on to the stack location which was used by R6 & R7. At the sametime register R1 also holds address of pointer to y and R0 holds address of pointer to x. THis is shown in attached diagram.

2. What are the values in R0 & R1 when swap_pointer() is called?
R0 holds the value of pointer to x and R1 holds value of pointer to y.

3. Share a screen shot of the local variables inside of “main” after the function swap_pointer() returns showing the values of the pointers and what they are pointing to (similar to the picture below). 
Screenshot is attached
