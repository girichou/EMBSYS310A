Q3] Bonus: Is there anything that can be done to optimize the usage of ROM or RAM resources? Explain any options that you come up with.

Following is the module summary from the map file,

	Upon deeper look, <zero_init3>  object take highest amount of ROM memory followed by <data_init>. These is used to inittialize the global variables which need inititialization. If we were to avoid initialized global variables/ static variables then this will reduce ROm consumption. But that also means we will have manage some how these variables during run time and that will impact run time performance. So there si trade off between ROm consumption, and run time performance.

	Similarly, most of RAM consumption is due to STACK size. If we know exactly the stack usage then we can minimize the STACK size and reduce the RAM usage.
